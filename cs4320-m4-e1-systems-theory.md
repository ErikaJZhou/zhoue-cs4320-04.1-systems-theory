# CS4320 Exercise 4.1 Systems Theory

CS4320 - Section 01, taught by Dr. Sean P. Goggins at the University of Missouri
Spring Semester 2022

The "Ethical Quandry" grid presents several possible ethical issues related to the public case of "A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit".
The individual systems it looks at are Retailer, E-commerce, Retail Industry, Big Tech Data Market, Economy, Internet Advertising, Retail Customers, Cybersecurity, Financial, and Legal. 
I chose these systems because they were related to the retail business or the usage of consumer data, including in digital form.
Some may be more closely tied to the issue, such as Retailer and Retail Customers, but there may be various ripple effects in the economy, and various tech players may be involved.
E-commerce, Big Tech Data Market, Internet Advertising, and Cybersecurity are systems with significant technical or socio-technical aspects.

Some of the ethical issues involved permission of the customers to have their data sold, and transparency in how it is being used or handled.
Another issue was targeting of consumers with personal advertisements.
How much retail customers care about their information being collected might vary.
It's possible that relatively few would want to go into the details of the retailer's privacy policy.
How ethical or unethical the information selling is may depend on who the data is being sold to and for what purposes.
